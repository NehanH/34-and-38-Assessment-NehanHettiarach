  <summary>What is Blender Lighting?</summary>
   <p>Lighting in Blender is the process of adding and manipulating light sources within a scene to create a desired mood, atmosphere, or realism. Proper lighting can enhance the visual appeal of a 3D model, highlight specific features, and create depth and contrast. Blender offers various types of lights, including point lights, spotlights, area lights, and sun lights, each with its unique properties and applications.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Task 1</summary>
  <p>Understanding Different Light Types: Experiment with different types of lights in Blender to understand their characteristics and how they affect a scene.</p>
  <p>1. Open Blender and create a new project</p>
  <p>2. Add a simple object to your scene, like a sphere.</p>
  <p>3. Experiment by adding different types of lights (Point, Spot, Area, Sun) and observe how they affect the object.</p>
  <p>4. Adjust the properties of each light, such as color, intensity, and size, to see how they change the lighting effect.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Task 2</summary>
  <p>Three-Point Lighting: Set up a basic three-point lighting system to understand how to create depth and dimension in your scene.</p>
  <p>1. Start with a primary object in your scene.</p>
  <p>2. Add a key light, which is the main source of light, typically placed to one side of the object casting shadows.</p>
  <p>3. Introduce a fill light on the opposite side to soften and reduce the shadows.</p>
  <p>4. Finally, add a back light behind the object to help separate it from the background and provide a three-dimensional look.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Task 3</summary>
  <p>Color in Lighting: Experiment with different colors in your light sources to set the mood and atmosphere of a scene.</p>
  <p>1. Add a light source to your scene.</p>
  <p>2. In the light's properties, adjust the color to something other than white.</p>
  <p>3. Observe how different colors can evoke different moods â€“ for example, blue might feel cold or night-like, while orange could evoke warmth or sunset.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Task 4</summary>
  <p>Shadow Play: Understand how to manipulate shadows using light sources.</p>
  <p>1. Place an object in your scene with a light source casting a shadow.</p>
  <p>2. Adjust the position, intensity, and size of the light to see how it affects the shadow's length and softness.</p>
  <p>3. Experiment with multiple light sources to see how overlapping shadows interact.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Task 5</summary>
  <p>Environment Lighting: Use HDRI (High Dynamic Range Imaging) to light your scene, providing realistic lighting based on real-world environments.</p>
  <p>1. Download an HDRI image suitable for your scene.</p>
  <p>2. In Blender, go to the World settings and set the environment texture to your downloaded HDRI.</p>
  <p>3. Rotate and scale the HDRI to achieve the desired lighting effect on your scene.</p>
